## Features

[Side assistant](#side-assistant) · [Translation](#translation) · [Split view](#split-view) · [Group chat](#group-chat) · [Squads](#squads) · [Routines and scheduling](#routines-and-scheduling) · [Seamless handoff](#seamless-handoff) · [To-dos](#to-dos) · [Quota at a glance](#quota-at-a-glance)

<sub>Looping demos use real UI components with sample data: the pointer makes real clicks, and small areas are zoomed in. The interface shown is in Chinese.</sub>

### Side assistant

Select part of a conversation, right-click and choose **Ask helper**: the side assistant opens on the right with the passage quoted, ready to explain, follow up, or take on a small task. It defaults to a lightweight model with its own context, so the main conversation stays focused.

<img src="docs/assets/features/assistant.webp" alt="Side assistant: select a term, right-click to hand it to the assistant, and ask about it on the right" width="100%" />

### Translation

Click **Translate** under a reply to read it in your language, and click again for the original; or select one sentence and translate it from the right-click menu. A lightweight model does the work outside the main conversation's context.

<img src="docs/assets/features/translation.webp" alt="Translation: translate a reply, switch back to the original, then translate one selected sentence" width="100%" />

### Split view

⌘-click another conversation, or choose **Open in right split pane** from its menu, to put two conversations side by side: work on an implementation while checking another agent's advice. Each pane has its own input, progress, and approval requests, with a draggable divider to adjust the space.

<img src="docs/assets/features/split.webp" alt="Split view: ⌘-click a second conversation to show Claude Code and Codex side by side, then type on the right" width="100%" />

### Group chat

Bring 2–5 agents into one conversation to answer independently, then respond to each other's ideas. Jump in or @ a member at any time, steer the pace with **Continue** and **Summarize now**, and let the chair summarize agreements and disagreements; discussions are read-only and do not change code.

<img src="docs/assets/features/discussion.webp" alt="Group chat: three agents answer independently, respond after Continue, and the chair summarizes after Summarize now" width="100%" />

### Squads

Assign agents, models, and roles to a leader, developers, and reviewers (expand a member to change them), then give the squad a task. The leader agrees on a plan with you before dispatching work in a shared worktree, with sequential development and parallel read-only analysis.

<img src="docs/assets/features/squad.webp" alt="Squads: click Edit and expand the developer to see its agent, model, and role" width="100%" />

### Routines and scheduling

Under **Routines** in the sidebar, schedule Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Pi, or DeepSeek Harness to work daily, on weekdays, or weekly; the clock beside the composer reserves a message for a set time or for when quota resets, and tasks and plan approvals can be reserved too. Routines can choose an agent with available quota; unattended runs answer prompts automatically based on permission modes. The computer must stay awake; Cursor and Antigravity are not supported for routines.

<img src="docs/assets/features/schedule.webp" alt="Scheduling: open routines and reservations from the sidebar, then reserve a message with the composer clock" width="100%" />

### Seamless handoff

When quota runs out or you want another approach, click the agent name at the bottom left of the composer, pick another one, and add a note to hand off the work. The next agent receives the visible chat history in the same working directory; switching back resumes the original agent's native session and fills in what happened while it was away.

<img src="docs/assets/features/handoff.webp" alt="Handoff: switch the composer from Claude Code to Codex, add a note, and Codex continues with tests" width="100%" />

### To-dos

When an agent's reply mentions things for you to do later (before release, to verify, to configure), it records them as the conversation's to-dos, and the inspector button in the header shows how many are open. Tick them off in the **To-dos** tab; **Overview → To-dos** gathers every conversation's to-dos, and items marked "Agent can do" can be handed back to the agent.

<img src="docs/assets/features/todos.webp" alt="To-dos: an agent records to-dos, the header inspector opens the to-dos tab to tick one off, and the overview lists them all" width="100%" />

### Quota at a glance

The status bar shows Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and Antigravity usage together; hover for each agent's quota windows and reset times. Settings switch between used and remaining percentages, with monthly usage for Cursor and reset credits or global reset announcements when available.

<img src="docs/assets/features/quota.webp" alt="Quota: zoom into the status bar, hover each agent for usage and reset times, then show remaining percentages" width="100%" />

<details>
<summary><b>More: from running tasks to reviewing results</b></summary>

- **Overview**: bring approvals, questions, and reviews together, with what is running and what comes next in view.
- **Task board**: isolated worktrees, multi-project tasks, and dependencies that unlock after acceptance.
- **Review and Git**: inspect the entire task branch, run project checks, and update from remote with fast-forward/rebase.
- **Files, terminals, and browser**: edit files, manage development servers, and let agents verify pages you can take over.
- **Model providers & multi-account**: connect third-party coding plans or custom endpoints; Claude Code and Codex support multi-account auto-switching on quota limits.
- **Usage analytics**: 7/30/90-day ledgers by model, account, and source, with countdowns to quota exhaustion.
- **Sources and extensions**: connect Jira, GitHub, Obsidian, Agent Skills, MCP servers, and import CLI sessions.
- **Local-first**: records stay on your machine, and background agents keep working when the window closes.

## Supported agents

Antumi drives the agent CLIs you already have installed and signed in to.

| Agent | Integration | Permission modes | Plan approval | Handoff | Routines / scheduling |
|---|---|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| [**Claude Code**](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) | `claude -p` (stream-json) | ask · accept edits · plan · auto | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| [**Codex**](https://github.com/openai/codex) | `codex app-server` | ask · auto · plan · read-only | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| [**Cursor**](https://cursor.com/cli) | `cursor-agent acp` | Agent · Plan · Ask | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| [**OpenCode**](https://opencode.ai) | `opencode acp` | Build · auto · Plan · read-only | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| [**Pi**](https://pi.dev) | `pi --mode rpc` | default · auto · plan · read-only | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| [**DeepSeek Harness**](docs/DEEPSEEK.md) | `dsh --profile antumi` (ACP) | default · automatic · plan · read-only | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| [**Antigravity**](docs/ANTIGRAVITY.md) | Google's Antigravity ACP server | Default · Auto Edit | — | ✓ | — |

"Bypass everything" is never selected by default. Settings → Agents also lists the agent CLIs Antumi recognises but does not drive yet.

## Getting started

**Prerequisite**: At least one agent ready (install CLI for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, Pi, or DeepSeek Harness; Antigravity can be downloaded directly in Settings).

**Run from source**, with Node ≥ 22.13 and pnpm 12:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flyhero/antumi.git
cd antumi
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # starts the daemon, core and the desktop app together
```

**Build a macOS app** (Apple Silicon):

```bash
pnpm dist:mac     # output: packages/desktop/dist/Antumi-<version>-arm64.dmg
```

**Build a Windows installer** (x64; it builds on macOS too):

```bash
pnpm dist:win     # output: packages/desktop/dist/Antumi-Setup-<version>-x64.exe
```

A machine with the app installed needs neither Node nor pnpm. The builds are unsigned: on another Mac, right-click → Open the first time; on Windows, SmartScreen stops it once, so choose More info → Run anyway.

## Local-first, safety-first

- **Your data stays with you**: tasks, conversations and worktrees live in `~/.antumi/`; nothing essential depends on a hosted Antumi service.
- **Loopback only**: core listens on `127.0.0.1` and every connection must present a token.
- **No shell in between**: agent commands are launched as argument arrays, with `--` before the prompt.
- **Credentials stay put**: Jira / GitHub credentials are stored separately (mode 600), never returned to the UI and never given to agents.
- **External content is untrusted**: imported issue text is wrapped in `<untrusted-source>` before an agent sees it; task images lose their EXIF data before they are stored.
- **Your results are never deleted for you**: worktrees are cleaned only when you confirm, re-checked right before, and anything with uncommitted changes or unique commits is kept.

## Contributing

Start with [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) (process boundaries, protocol, commit format) and [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) (visual rules). Before committing:

```bash
pnpm typecheck && pnpm test     # plus pnpm build for desktop changes
```

To try the app by hand without touching your real data, run a separate instance against a test home:

```bash
ANTUMI_HOME=~/.antumi-demo pnpm dev
```

## Status

Antumi is currently in **development preview** (0.20.x), developed and tested mainly on macOS (Windows runs and packages). Next, in order:

- **Windows testing**: Polishing auto-updates, real-machine installation and CI.
- **Remote execution**: Let agents work on repositories over SSH / WSL while the board stays local.
- **More agents and ecosystem**: Expanding support for more agent CLIs and ACP servers.

Something feels off, or you want another agent supported? [Open an issue](https://github.com/flyhero/antumi/issues).

## The name

**Antumi is a coined word inspired by "ant".** One ant is small; together they move things far bigger than themselves. Antumi brings different AI coding agents onto one workbench so work can move forward in parallel while progress and results stay visible.

The mascot is a little ant: it holds three agent blocks on the app icon.
